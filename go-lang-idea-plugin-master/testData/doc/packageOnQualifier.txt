<b>Package io</b>
<p><code>import "io"</code></p>
<p>Package io provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives.
Its primary job is to wrap existing implementations of such primitives,
such as those in package os, into shared public interfaces that
abstract the functionality, plus some other related primitives.
</p>
<p>Because these interfaces and primitives wrap lower-level operations with
various implementations, unless otherwise informed clients should not
assume they are safe for parallel execution.
