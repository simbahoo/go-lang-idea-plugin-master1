<p>Clean returns the shortest path name equivalent to path
by purely lexical processing.  It applies the following rules
iteratively until no further processing can be done:
</p>
<pre>	1. Replace multiple slashes with a single slash.
	2. Eliminate each . path name element (the current directory).
	3. Eliminate each inner .. path name element (the parent directory)
	   along with the non-.. element that precedes it.


	4. Eliminate .. elements that begin a rooted path:
	   that is, replace &quot;/..&quot; by &quot;/&quot; at the beginning of a path.</pre>
<p>The returned path ends in a slash only if it is the root &quot;/&quot;.
